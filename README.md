# Flying Through The Years
### Author:Jeremiah Rubin-BlackXWulf
# Overview
This Project Analyzes aviation data accidents about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. The project will focus more on airplane accidents.The aviation comapanies that make airplanes can use this analysis to improve and or add more engines to their airplanes for more safer flying and reduction of injury incidents.
# Business Understanding

Aviation companies in America can reduce accidents and incidents through improving there airplane engines or adding additionally engines. Doing so will reduce incidents in the air and or crashing. Using Aviation data I'll describe patterns of accidents and incidents through the years on how many engines each plane had in each injury incident.
# Data Understanding
The Aviation accident database has a long list of years from the 1960's to 2023 about the accidents and how many engines they have with the injury reports per incident.
## Data Preperation
After getting the data for the number of engines and injury severity incidents data and accident dates, I will be prepping the data to focus on number of engines and injury severity
# Exploratory Data Ananlysis
After cleaning the data I'll be creating a bar chart showing the average number of engines and injury severity
# Conclusion
